# NowYou-reTalking
Social media with a positive purpose 

Now You're Talk'n is an app that offers moderated discussion for controversial topics. Topics are pulled from google news and twitter ensuring that each topic has traction as well as link to a reputable news article on google. Users can then select the topic (headline) that seems the most intersecting. The users can then either decide their opinion with the opinion buttons or click the article for more information.

Once an initial decision is made users are placed into groups based on the percentage of people that agree upon it. i.e. In groups of 10 if 50% of users in the group would vote yes or agree with the headline and 50% disagree then the group would be 5 to 5 and so on. Users are then taken to the discussions page where they can then discuss their opinions, link articles, change sides and tag favorite topics to the favorites page.
