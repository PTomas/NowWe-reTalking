#Now We're Talking

Now We’re Talking is an app that aims to change the way the people around the world communicate for and about change in their governments by facilitating the debate process. Now We’re Talking allows users to view issues/legislation in scrolling cells on the topics page. Once an item is clicked the user shall be able to agree or disagree with the issue.

Upon making a decision users are then placed into groups of 10 for debate where they can link articles from the scrolling link view(horizontal) in the message board area for the discussions page. The groups shall be placed in is balanced by the percentage of total users that agree or disagree ie. if 50% agree the ratio should be 5-5 and so on. In this way, users shall be able to act as representatives of their opinion in a real debate setting. each time a user is convinced to change opinions (using the opinion buttons also located on the discussion page) users in that group are placed into a new group still balanced by the percentage of total user opinions. topics shall be able to be favourited on the discussion page as well. Once tagged as a favourite the topic shall appear on the favourites page.

A graph of total user opinions on that topic(highlighted) as well as others shall also be available upon clicking the title on the graphs page. The UI with a few exceptions has been created.

I need someone with experience to build the server as well as to register as a business with the state of California. The funds will go towards business registration fees,  server space, and the hiring of a programmer. I strongly believe this project has the power to benefit the world in so many ways.
