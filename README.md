#Now You're Talking
What if we could change the world? What if we could change views on gun control before a life is taken. What if we could change views on climate change before we run out of time to find solutions. What if we could talk about our problems, combat polorization and see the changes that we want. We could change the world.

Now You're Talking is a moderated discussion board that selects controversial news stories and assembles users with differing opinions into chat groups, balanced by aggregated user statistics.

Now You're Talking is an app that aims to change the way the people around the world communicate and organizes for change in their governments. What's Talking allows users to post issues/legislation to the topics page. Once an item is clicked the user shall be able to agree or disagree with the issue.

Upon making a decision users are then placed into groups of 10 for debate on the discussions page. These groups shall be balanced by the percentage of total users that agree or disagree ie. if 50% agree the ratio should be 5-5 and so on. In this way, users shall be able to act as representatives of their opinion in a real debate setting. each time a user is convinced to change opinions (using the opinion buttons also located on the discussion page) users in that group are placed into a new group still balanced by the percentage of total user opinions. A graph of total user opinions shall also be available on the discussion page.

topics shall be able to be favourited on this page as well. Once tagged as a favourite the topic shall appear on the favourites page. Attached is a flowchart of the different parts of the platform including UIPages(Rounded Rectangle), UIActions(Elipsis), and Server Functions(Rectangles) Which shall be written in swift and whatever you determine fit for the server.
