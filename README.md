# NowYou-reTalking
What if we could change the world? What if we could change views on gun control before a life is taken. What if we could change views on climate change before we run out of time to find solutions. What if we could talk about our problems, combat polorization and see the changes that we want. We could change the world.

What's Talking is a moderated discussion board that selects controversial news stories and assembles users with differing opinions into chat groups, balanced by aggregated user statistics.

Topics are pulled from google news and twitter ensuring that each topic has traction as well as link to a reputable news article on google. Users can then select the topic (headline) that seems the most intersecting. The users can then either decide their opinion with the opinion buttons or click the article for more information.

Once an initial decision is made users are placed into groups based on the percentage of total users that agree upon it. i.e. In groups of 10 if 50% of users would vote yes or agree with the headline and 50% disagree then the group would be 5 to 5 and so on. Users are then taken to the discussions page where they can then discuss their opinions, link articles, and change sides. When an opinion is changed groups are reordinized until the percentage of total user beliefs change. This allows users to see the impact that they are making. To keep the discussion going users can also tag favorite topics to the favorites page.
