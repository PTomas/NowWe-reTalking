# NowYou-reTalking
Social media with a positive purpose 

Now You're Talk'n is an app that offers moderated discussion for controversial topics. Topics are pulled from google news and twitter ensuring that each topic has traction as well as link to a reputable news article on google. Users can then select the topic (headline) that seems the most intersecting. The users can then either decide their opinion with the opinion buttons or click the article for more information.

Once an initial decision is made users are placed into groups based on the percentage of total users that agree upon it. i.e. In groups of 10 if 50% of users would vote yes or agree with the headline and 50% disagree then the group would be 5 to 5 and so on. Users are then taken to the discussions page where they can then discuss their opinions, link articles, and change sides. When an opinion is changed groups are reordinized until the percentage of total user beliefs change. This allows users to see the impact that they are making. To keep the discussion going users can also tag favorite topics to the favorites page.

To moderate discussion Now You're Talking uses effective focus groups that keep spam and over crowing out. Users are rewarded with points for changing sides and posting reputable sources and being in a group that has reached a verdict(when all users agree).
